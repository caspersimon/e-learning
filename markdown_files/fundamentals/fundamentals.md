# Keeping People Interested


Most of the content we see today is served to us by an algorithm that decides which videos are of high quality and which ones are not. There are two key aspects to think about: ***retention* and *engagement***. 

What follows is an overview of practical tips. It is impossible to consider every tip for every video, so you should not think of these tips as hard principles to adhere to in every case. Instead, see them as a general guideline for things you can consider when making a video.
## Retention
**Retention** relates to how long someone watches your video. When someone watches more of your video, this informs the algorithm that it is of high quality. Below, there are some things you can think about to increase retention.
### Titles and *hooks*
From the moment your video pops up on someones feed, your video needs to catch someones attention. 
Your title should give someone a reason to continue watching your video. You can do this by clearly **providing value** to the viewer, for example with titles such as:
- *Study spots in Amsterdam ✨*
- *Websites that will help you with your ✨research✨*

You can also invite people to continue watching by using some **unexpected** title such as:
- *✨Student room tour✨ - Former prison edition*

Another good strategy for coming up with titles is structuring your video into **numbered lists**. This immediately makes clear what someone can expect from your video, and that makes someone more willing to invest their attention into it. Examples include:
- *3 steps to never fail exams again*
- *Week of lectures - Economics and Business Economics at University of Amsterdam*

While these titles are important, it is also good to think about what you say at the start of the video. One way you can *hook* viewers and convince them to continue watching is by using words such as "you."
For example, the *Study spots in Amsterdam ✨* video started with the text:
   
*Are **you** getting bored of studying at home? Here are some other spots **you** can try out!*

Another example, this was the start of the *3 steps to never fail exams again* video:

*If **you** never want to fail an exam again, this is the best study method **you** can use!*


**TL;DR:**
Create a title that makes it clear which value it provides to the viewer and sets expectations for what they will see.
### Pacing
You've heard it before: people's attention spans are not what they used to be. That is why it is important that your video does not bore people.

**Pacing** is about the speed at which your video delivers information. To maximise retention, it is important that your viewer does not get bored. There should *almost* be an overload of information.

In general, you should:
- Cut every silence from the video
- Start delivering information immediately (i.e., avoid saying phrases such as "Hey guys" at the start of a video)
- Have many different b-roll clips

You will see some examples in the next part.


## Engagement
**Engagement** relates to whether people like, comment, save and/or share a video. Ideally, you create your video in a way that invites people to press all the buttons.

You should think of ways to make your video more funny, relatable, useful and include unexpected/notable elements to encourage people to engage with the video.
