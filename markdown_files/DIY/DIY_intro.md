# Raw files download
By now, you should have some idea of how to approach a video project. 
To practice with editing a video, you can choose to re-edit one of two videos. Pick whichever one you think would be most fun to work on.

Download the raw files and make your own version of the video! If you get stuck, you can also download the finished project to see how the edits were made previously.
