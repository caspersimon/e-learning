## Video: come work for us


There is definitely room for improvement with this video: I forgot to do j-cuts so it is a bit slow. Your task: make it better.

Unfortunately I lost the file for the music, so it's a fun exercise to find fitting music yourself ;)

The raw files include:
- 1 video of me talking to the camera
- 2 images
- 5 past videos used as b-roll
- 2 screen recordings used as b-roll

Raw files: 1GB

Finished project: 1GB
