# A guide to the software you will need
## Video editing software
In this e-learning, most of the editing is done in Final Cut Pro (FCP). This is powerful video-editing software that is still easy to use. The subtitles are added using CapCut.

You are free to use any other editing software that suits your preferences best. The tutorials show how things work in FCP, but many other software works in similar ways. If you own a Mac and have little or no previous experience with editing videos, it is highly recommended you use FCP. If you use a Windows computer, you can choose to use free software such as [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/nl/products/davinciresolve), or choose to do all your editing in CapCut.

**Downloading FCP and CapCut**
- You can download a 90-day free trial of Final Cut Pro from [Apple's website](https://www.apple.com/nl/final-cut-pro/trial/). After 90 days, you can easily [reset this 90 day trial period](/fcp_trial).
- You can download CapCut from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/capcut-video-editor/id1500855883) (recommended if you have a Mac) or from [CapCut's website](https://www.capcut.com/tools/desktop-video-editor).
