# Introduction

Welcome to this e-learning! When you go through this website, you will learn all about creating high-quality videos for social media.

The material is divided into four parts:

First, you will learn about how your videos should look. What are the best practices with titles? How can you make your videos so that people keep watching?

Second, you will learn about what goes on behind the scenes. You will download and install the right software and then see how to use that software from start to finish. You will learn about edits like using j-cuts, zooming in and out, adding titles, using keyframes, etc.

Third, you will practice with editing a video. You will download the raw material from a video that was posted in the past and your task will be to re-edit it in your own way!

Finally, there is some extra material that you might come back to later when you need it, or might already look at if you're interested. This includes information and tutorials about some extra effects you might want to try out, instructions of how to improve sound quality, and instructions of how to reset the trial period of Final Cut Pro.

## Creating videos is an art, not a science
In this e-learning you will learn about best practices and how videos were made in the past. But please do not take any information presented here as absolute facts. It can be rewarding and fulfilling to try out new things. Everything in this e-learning should therefore be read as a guide, not a strict rulebook.
