In general, it is also good to cut **all** redundant parts of your video. Your viewer will notice these cuts, but this is not a bad thing if you do it right. That is:
1. **Use J-cuts** to make the video smooth.
2. **Keep the sentence structure logical.** You can reconstruct sentences as much as you want, as long as they make sense in the end.
3. **Keep the eyes of your subjects in the same place on-screen.** Your viewer is most likely looking at the eyes of the person in the video. When you cut, it is important that their eyes remain in the same place. 
Otherwise, your viewers' eyes will have to constantly adjust, which is annoying and kills the flow of your video.
