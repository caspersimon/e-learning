# Background music
Most videos have some music playing in the background. This can help with the pacing of your videos.

To find music you can use on TikTok and Instagram, there are a few resources I can recommend:
1. **Youtube's audio library**. You can find it by heading over to https://studio.youtube.com/ and then navigating to the audio library. Make sure you filter for music for which attribution is not required. 
   What is great about YouTube's audio library is that the music in here can usually be used on every platform, so also on TikTok and Instagram. You can also download the music to be used right in your editor, which is convenient.
2. [**Meta's sound collection**](https://www.facebook.com/sound/collection)
   Like YouTubes's audio library, you can find and download audio to use. Unlike YouTube's audio library, you might not be allowed to use the music on TikTok as well. It might take some digging to find out whether a song is also allowed on TikTok.
3. [**TikTok's commercial audio library**](https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/music/pc/en)
   You can use this website to find music, but it does not allow you to download the music into your own projects. So when you want to use a song from here, you should tell Bridget and she'll add it in during the posting of this video.
   Also, not every song in here can also be used on Instagram. It might take some digging to find out whether a song is also on Instagram.
