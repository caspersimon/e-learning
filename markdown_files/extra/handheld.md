## Making steady videos less steady using the Handheld effect
You will probably shoot most videos whilst holding your phone in your hand. This makes it so that the video will not be entirely steady, and that is often a good thing.

Sometimes, your video might turn out to be a bit too steady to your liking. Luckily, you can slightly shake the video in post.

Examples of when it was used:
**For the study room post**: adding the handheld effect made the video more chaotic. 
**For the 8000 followers post**: the clip where the sign on the wall says "8000th floor" was actually just a photo. To make it appear like it was a video, the handheld effect was added.

Using the handheld effect is very easy! Under the video effects pane, under *Stylize*, you can find it. Or use the search bar. Drag and drop it onto a clip or adjustment layer. You can adjust the *Shakiness* (how fast it shakes) and *Distance* (how far it zooms in).
