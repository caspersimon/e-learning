# Fixing broken audio
If the audio of a clip has a lot of background noise or sounds like it was recorded using a potato, you can use [Adobe's Enhance Speech](https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance#) feature. This is a tool that allows you to upload an audio file, it then uses AI to aggressively remove all background noise. Below are four steps to get this enhanced audio and link it back to your video. These steps take less than 10 minutes to do and can drastically improve audio quality.

If you decide to use it, it is best to do this **at the very start of the editing process**, even before making a rough cut. You can also use it at the end of editing, but this will increase the chance that the voices will sound distorted.

## How to use Enhance Speech: 4 simple steps
**1. Add all your clips to your project in FCP**
Add each clip to your timeline. In total, your clips should not be longer than 30 minutes. If all your clips together are longer than 30 minutes, you can remove parts at the beginning or end of each clip, but do not make cuts in the clips itself. If you still have more than 30 minutes, remove clips and repeat these four steps later.

**2. Export your clips to an audio file**
Navigate to *File* > *Share* > *Export file* or press *⌘+E*

In the "Export File" window, under "Settings":
- for *Format*, choose *Audio Only*
- for *Audio Format*, choose *WAV* (higher quality) or *MP3* (lower file size)
- for *Action*, choose *Save Only*

**3. Run the audio through Enhance Speech**
Simply upload the file to [Adobe's Enhance Speech](https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance#) website and let it process. This should not take more than a few minutes. After it's done, download the file.

**4. Link the new audio file to the original clips**
Once you have your new audio file, import it into your library.

Then, in your browser with all your clips (top left of the screen) select the new audio file and one of the clips you want to sync the audio to. (_You can select multiple files at the same time by holding the Command key (⌘) and clicking on the files you want to select._) In the menu bar, navigate to *Clip* > *Synchronize Clips* or press *⌥ + ⌘ + G*. You can use the default settings to sync the clips. Repeat these steps for each clip.

In your media browser, you will find the newly created synchronised clips to use in your project.

For a more detailed explanation of how to sync the audio back to the clips, see [this support page on Apple's website.](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/final-cut-pro/verc1fabc30/mac#:~:text=In%20the%20Final%20Cut%20Pro,selection%20and%20choose%20Synchronize%20Clips.)

### A note about the quality of Enhance Speech
When you use this feature, you might notice that the audio might sound a bit distorted or artificial sometimes. You might also notice that certain words are pronounced differently than usual. To combat this, you are advised to keep a mix of the enhanced audio and the original audio. At moments when the enhanced audio sounds particularly bad, you can consider lowering its volume and increasing the loudness of the original audio. To make this sound smooth, use keyframes to gradually adjust the loudness over the span of a few seconds.
