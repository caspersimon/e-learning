# In practice
This chapter will mostly focus on choices made whilst editing the video. When you edit a video, your main goal is to make sure your viewer does not get bored.

Below, you will see examples of some techniques you can use for this.

## Short clips and B-roll footage
One of the most important ways of making sure your viewer does not get bored is frequently switching the clip that they see. 
One way to do this is by adding B-roll footage. These are short clips that play whilst information is being delivered to them.

## J-cuts
You might not be familiar with the name *J-cut*, but you have definitely seen j-cuts before! 
It is when the audio of a next clip comes in before the video of that clip is visible.

This has two advantages:

First, it makes the video easier to watch. 
When the audio of a clip comes in before the video of that clip comes in, your viewer only has to process one new stream of information at a time.
This makes for a comfortable watching experience, which you want.

Second, it removes some of the silent space in a video. When you use j-cuts, you will notice that you can already start the next 
sentence whilst the previous sentence is still being said. When you use j-cuts all throughout your video, this shaves off a few seconds of the total duration.
