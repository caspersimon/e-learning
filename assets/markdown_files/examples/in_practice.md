# In practice
This chapter focuses on choices you make while editing a video. When youâ€™re doing this, your main goal is to make sure your viewer does not get bored.

Below, you will see examples of some techniques you can use for this.


## Short clips and B-roll footage
One of the most important ways of making sure your viewer does not get bored is frequently switching the clip that they see. One way to do this is by adding B-roll footage. B-roll refers to short clips that play while information is being delivered to them.

## J-cuts
You might not be familiar with the name *J-cut*, but you have definitely seen it in action! It is when the audio of a next clip comes in before the video of that clip is visible.

### This has 2 advantages:

First, it makes the video easier to watch. When the audio of a clip comes in before the video of that clip comes in, your viewer only has to process one new stream of information at a time. This makes for a comfortable watching experience, which you want.

Second, j-cuts remove some of the silent spaces in a video. When you use them, you will notice that you can start the next sentence while the previous sentence is still being said. When you use j-cuts all throughout your video, you can shorten the total duration by a few seconds.
