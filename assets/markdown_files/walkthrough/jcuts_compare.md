**CapCut**

In CapCut, you have to make the audio a separate track from your video to make J-cuts. To do this, right-click on your video track, then click 'extract audio.' **Be careful to keep the audio in sync with your video.** Because you have now separated the audio and video to two different tracks, always select both the video and audio track when you move the clips around.

**DaVinci Resolve**

In DaVinci Resolve, you can make j-cuts by holding the ‚å• (alt or option) key and then dragging the video or audio track forward or backward.
