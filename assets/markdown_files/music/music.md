# Background music
Most videos have some music playing in the background. This can help with the pacing and overall feel of your videos.

To find music you can use on TikTok and Instagram, there are a few resources I can recommend:

1. **Youtube's audio library**. You can access it by heading over to https://studio.youtube.com/ and navigating to the audio library. Be sure to filter for music that doesnâ€™t require attribution. The great thing about YouTube's audio library is that the music typically can be used on all platforms, including TikTok and Instagram. You can also download the music to be used right in your editor, which is convenient.
2. [**Meta's sound collection**](https://www.facebook.com/sound/collection)
   Like YouTubes's audio library, you can find and download audio to use. Unlike YouTube's audio library, you might not be allowed to use the music on TikTok. It might take some digging to find out if you can also use a song on TikTok.
3. [**TikTok's commercial audio library**](https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/music/pc/en)
   library You can use this website to find music, but it does not allow you to download the music into your own projects. So when you want to use a song from here, you should tell Bridget and she'll add it in during the posting of this video. Keep in mind that not every song in TikTok's library is available for use on Instagram, so you may need to check if the track can also be used there.
