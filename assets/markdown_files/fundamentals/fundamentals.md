# Keeping People Interested


Most of the content we see today is served to us by an algorithm that decides which videos are of high quality and which ones are not. There are 2 key aspects to think about: ***retention*** and ***engagement***.

What follows is an overview of practical tips. It is impossible to apply every tip to every video. These should be seen as hard principles you need to follow in every case. Instead, see them as a general guideline for things you might consider when making a video.
## Retention
**Retention** is about how long someone watches your video. The longer someone watches, the more the algorithm perceives the video as high quality. Below are some things you can consider for increasing retention.
### Titles and *hooks*
The moment your video pops up on someones feed, it needs to grab their attention. Your title should give someone a reason to continue watching your video. You can do this by clearly highlighting your video’s **value to the viewer**, using titles like:

- *Study spots in Amsterdam ✨*
- *Websites that will help you with your ✨research✨*

You can also invite people to continue watching by using some **unexpected** title such as:
- *✨Student room tour✨ - Former prison edition*

Another good strategy for coming up with titles is structuring your videos into **numbered lists**. This immediately makes clear what viewers can expect, making them more willing to invest their attention. Examples include:

- *3 steps to never fail exams again*
- *Week of lectures - Economics and Business Economics at University of Amsterdam*

While these titles are important, it is also good to think about what you say at the start of the video. One way you can hook viewers and convince them to continue watching is by using words such as ‘you’ For example, the *Study spots in Amsterdam ✨* video started with the text:
   
*Are **you** getting bored of studying at home? Here are some other spots **you** can try out!*

Another example, this was the start of the *3 steps to never fail exams again* video:

*If **you** never want to fail an exam again, this is the best study method **you** can use!*


**TL;DR:**
Create a title that makes it clear which value it provides to the viewer and sets expectations for what they will see.
### Pacing
You've heard it before: people's attention spans are not what they used to be. That is why it is important that your video does not bore people.

**Pacing** is about the speed at which your video delivers information. To maximise retention, it is important that your viewer does not get bored. There should *almost* be an overload of information.

In general, you should:
- Cut every silence from the video
- Start delivering information immediately (i.e., avoid saying phrases such as 'Hey guys' at the start of a video)
- Have many different b-roll clips

You will see some examples in the next part.


## Engagement
**Engagement** is all about how much people interact with your video—whether they like, comment, save, or share it. The goal is to create content that encourages viewers to hit all those buttons.

To boost engagement, think about making your video funny, relatable, or useful, and try to include unexpected or notable elements. These are the things that inspire people to engage.
