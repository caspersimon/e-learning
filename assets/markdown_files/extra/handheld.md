## Making steady videos less steady using the Handheld effect
You will probably shoot most videos while holding your phone in your hand. This naturally makes the video a bit unsteady, which often adds a nice touch.

However, there may be times when your video turns out too steady for the effect you want. Luckily, you can add a slight shake to the video in post-production.


Here are some examples where this was used: 

* Study room post: adding the handheld effect made the video more chaotic. 
* 8000 followers post: the clip where the sign on the wall says ‘8000th floor’ was actually a photo. To make it look like a video, the handheld effect was applied.

Using the handheld effect is very easy! You can find it under the video effects pane, under *Stylize*. Or use the search bar. Drag and drop it onto a clip or adjustment layer. You can adjust the *Shakiness* (how fast it shakes) and *Distance* (how far it zooms in).
